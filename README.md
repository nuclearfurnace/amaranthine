Synchrotron is a caching layer load balancer, in the spirit of [Twemproxy](https://github.com/twitter/twemproxy) and [mcrouter](https://github.com/facebook/mcrouter).

# archived!

After going another direction at work, this project is now archived!  My hope is that some of the design can act as an inspiration, although given the heavy `futures@0.1` basis of the project, it may be less relevant in the async/await world than I think.

# Why another one?

There's a few things here:
- I wanted to write a real piece of software in Rust, not just toy programs!
- Twemproxy is basically deprecated
- mcrouter is advanced but only supports memcached

Essentially, this project aims to be a mix of Twemproxy and mcrouter: memcached _and_ Redis support with advanced features like traffic shadowing, pool warm up, and online reconfiguration... while being written in Rust: a systems programming language whose community, IMO, is second to none.

# What's done?

Here is a non-exhaustive checklist of what's done and what is a serious target:

- [x] Redis support
- [ ] memcached support
- [x] Redis pipelining support
- [x] basic connection multiplexing (M client conns over N server conns; configurable server connection limit)
- [x] advanced connection multiplexing (server backoff after failure, timeout on backend operations, etc)
- [x] basic routing strategies (single pool, traffic shadowing)\*
- [ ] advanced routing strategies (warm up [cold before warm], prefix routing, fallthrough, majority, fastest response)
- [x] distribution (modulo vs ketama) and hashing (md5 vs sha vs fnv1a) support\*
- [x] online reconfiguration
- [x] metrics collection\*
- [ ] TLS support

* - while the scaffolding is present, all options may not be i.e. not all hash methods may be implemented, etc
